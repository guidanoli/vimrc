# My personal .vimrc file

Once upon a time, I had some issues with upgrading my operating system from Linux Mint 19.3 to 20.0.
The problem was that some foreign packages could not be purged because apparently some essential package depended on them (?).
I then decided to simply wipe out all my partition and start with a brand new Linux Mint 20.2 installation.
Since I thought I had nothing on my hard drive that wasn't in the cloud or that I couldn't install again, I simply did no backup.
When I then booted my freshly installed Linux machine, I noticed two things that I was used to all the time were missing:
The vim editor program (which I easily and readily installed with apt-get), and my `.vimrc` file.
The latter, as you might have guessed, was not in any older backup of mine.
That's the reason why I decided to make it here public for whoever is interested, and for myself, if that ever happens again.
